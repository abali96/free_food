See http://www.arjunbali.com/#uw_freeloader for the detailed tech stack and photo gallery!

This project was completed during Hack the North, a 36-hour hackathon hosted by the University of Waterloo.

Waterloo Freeloader helps students find free food on campus. The food postings are curated by parsing Facebook events happening at Waterloo, supplemented by student postings, and verified by the community. Students become aware of free food two ways: automated text message notifications and a mobile-ready web app. 

Once event data is string-matched and processed for the likelihood of free food, users require just one click to get on-campus directions to their next meal. After users have arrived, they are required to report the quantity of food remaining, growing the community.
