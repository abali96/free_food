# Waterloo Freeloader

### About Section

First year students at the University of Waterloo are both broke and hungry. We help them find free food on campus.

Our food postings are curated by parsing Facebook events happening at Waterloo, supplemented by student postings, and verified by the community. Students become aware of free food two ways: automated text message notifications and a mobile-ready web app. Once event data is string-matched and processed for the likelihood of free food, users require just one click to get on-campus directions to their next meal. After users have arrived, they are required to report the quantity of food remaining, growing the community.
